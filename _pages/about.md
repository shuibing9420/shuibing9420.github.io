I’m currently a Professor at the College of Computer Science and Technology, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), China. I received my Ph.D. in computer science and technology from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2009. My research interests include **intelligent computing, parallel and distributed computing, file and storage systems, non-volatile memory, in-memory computing, operating systems, and big data processing**.

I’m a distinguished member of the China Computer Federation (CCF) and a committee member of the Information Storage Technology Specialized Committee of CCF, and an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). I’m also the PI or Co-PI of over 10 grants sponsored by the National Science Foundation of China, National Key Research and Development Program and Alibaba-Inc, among others. I’ve published almost 80 papers in esteemed international conferences and journals, including ASPLOS, MICRO, HPCA, TC, TPDS, TOS.

Additionally, I have served as the Technical Program Committee members and for several conferences, including ChinaSys, ICPE, and CCFSys, and also as reviewers many prestigious journals and conferences, such as TPDS, TC, TMC, TOS, JPDC, PARCO, and JCST, etc. I’ve also applied for more than 40 patents and seven software copyrights. My contributions to the community led me to win the 2020 IEEE TPDS Award for Editorial Excellence, the third prize of the Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Information Achievement Award in 2019-2020, and the Best Paper Award at the SPEED'2008 workshop.
